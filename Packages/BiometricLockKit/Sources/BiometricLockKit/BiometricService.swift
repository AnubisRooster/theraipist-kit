/// A "unlock with Face ID / Touch ID" primitive built on `LocalAuthentication`,
/// with a domain-state anti-tamper check layered on top.
///
/// This module is **standalone** — it owns no fallback UI and has no dependency
/// on `PINLockKit`. Any non-`.success` result is the host's signal to present
/// its own fallback (typically the `PINLockKit` screen); see the README for the
/// wiring.
///
/// ### Anti-tamper
/// A successful biometric match isn't sufficient on its own: someone who
/// enrolls *their own* face in Settings would then pass Face ID. To catch that,
/// the first successful unlock records `evaluatedPolicyDomainState` as a
/// baseline; every later unlock compares against it and returns
/// `.biometryChanged` if the enrolled set changed — forcing a PIN fallback.
/// After the PIN is verified, call `acceptCurrentBiometry()` to re-baseline.
